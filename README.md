## Monitoring Data on Your Phone

To monitor pressure, temperature, and humidity values on your phone, follow these steps:

1. Connect your ESP32 to a Wi-Fi network.
2. Download and install the Blynk application on your smartphone.
3. In the Blynk app, when selecting indicators, ensure that you choose the same ports as specified in the code.
